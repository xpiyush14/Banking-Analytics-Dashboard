# Banking Analytics Dashboard üìä

## üöÄ About The Project

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a banking dataset using both Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Power BI for interactive visualization. The goal is to uncover actionable insights into client demographics, financial behavior, and overall bank performance. The findings are summarized in an interactive dashboard, a detailed report, and a presentation deck.

This repository contains all the necessary components to understand the project's scope, methodology, and key outcomes.

## üî¨ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python

Before creating the dashboard, a thorough exploratory data analysis was conducted using Python in the `Banking.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. This initial analysis helped in understanding the data's structure, identifying patterns, and cleaning the dataset.

Key libraries used include:
* **Pandas:** For data loading, manipulation, and cleaning.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating static visualizations to explore data distributions, correlations, and relationships between variables.

The EDA process involved checking for missing values, analyzing the distribution of numerical columns like `Age` and `Estimated Income`, and understanding the frequency of categorical data such as `Occupation` and `Loyalty Classification`. This foundational analysis informed the design and focus of the Power BI dashboard.

## ‚ú® Dashboard Key Features

The Power BI dashboard provides a multi-faceted view of the bank's data, focusing on:

* **Executive KPI Summary:** At-a-glance metrics for **Total Clients**, **Total Deposits**, **Total Loans**, and **Average Client Risk Profile**.
* **Client Demographic Analysis:** An interactive deep dive into customer profiles, including distributions by **Age**, **Occupation**, and **Nationality**.
* **Financial Performance:** Visualizations comparing key financial metrics such as **Bank Deposits vs. Bank Loans** across different client segments.
* **Loyalty & Segmentation:** Analysis of customer loyalty tiers (e.g., Jade, Gold, Platinum) to identify the most valuable client groups.
* **Geographic Insights:** A map visualization showing the geographic distribution of the client base.
